Linux-based Operating Systems -course shananigans
-------------------------------------------------

Tasks and practices from the said course.
- All files, directories and commands are done from linux terminal if not said otherwise.
- All programs used in tasks are installed through linux terminal.
- All files are written in nano.

Practice1:
----------
- Extra basic linux commands and mildly refreshing memory of last year C++ studies.

Practice2:
----------
- Task1: getting to know make
- Task2: getting to know man-pages
- Task3: getting to know gdb-debugger
- Allocating an array from dynamic memory with C

Practice3:
----------
- Task1: listing all command line arguments after the first one.
- Task2: using execve() for simple command line ls
- Task3: use task2 as a child process
- Task4: update task3 so the path and possible command for execve() comes from command line 
- Task5: update task4 so the program asks earlier command line arguments in a while loop

Practice4:

- Task1: practice pipe lines. I wrote the file with Word.
- Task2: Using man, study about errno and perror() and create simple program using them.

- 5 essey tasks explaining what kind of problems threat handling can have and how to counter those. Wrote these in Finnish and with Word.

Practice7:
----------
- Task1: explain why does the number change in the code and suggest workaround for it.
- Task2: repair the task1 problem with mutex by explaining it.
- Task3: create program: create big array and print last 100 index in terminal. create "-s" option when run from cmd.
- Task4: add threads to task 3 and study how does threads effect on program runtime.

-----------
- Task1: Find out how to see how much memory usage is with pip. Written in Word.
- Task2: Explain memory segments. Written in Word.
- Task3: create and use static and dynamic library c++. Raport written with Word.
